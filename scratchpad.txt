=========================================

flex-wrap in bars css


code duplication in driver.ts:
    container_item
    inner_item 


QuizGenerator.test.ts can be a good integration test then a unit test with many mocks; IDK

remove duplication in assertElement

remove duplication in clickingOnButtons

refactor Driver class into smaller class


I could use something like; IDK lets wait if i really need this
let mainPageAsserter = PageAsserter.for(mainContainer);
// and calling it like 
mainPageAsserter.assertElement(1, 'BUTTON', "Play");
