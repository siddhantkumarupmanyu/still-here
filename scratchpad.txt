=========================================

integrate real bars in Bars Database or it takes a json file from which it gets Bars
    file which can be mocked in the tests

remove duplication in assertElement

remove duplication in clickingOnButtons

refactor Driver class into smaller class


I could use something like; IDK lets wait if i really need this
let mainPageAsserter = PageAsserter.for(mainContainer);
// and calling it like 
mainPageAsserter.assertElement(1, 'BUTTON', "Play");
