[Verse 1]

14 saal, London sheher
Likha pehla rap
Wo tha moment
Fell in love the pen and pad

Mere paas bhi tha will jaise Men in black
School me dete dhamki me bhi sunki
I just send it back

School ka sabse popular rapper tha Troy
Radio pe uske gaane everybody knew the boy

Usne naam diya mujhe, undercover thug
Kyunki shakal se sharif but on the mic I fuck it up

Validation thodi aane lagi haath
School me gangster dete bhav, karne lage mujhse baat

Ibrahim bana dost, sunta Cormega aur Nas
Uski wajah se mene jaake recording kari start

Barnfield estate me tha kisi ka stu
Jisme gaana record karne ki icha thi meri khoob

Toh Naam rakha Phyxer aur banaya mene crew
Bane hum ‘The Royal Rappers’ in 2002
(That's how it goes)


[Chorus]

I Just had a dream
Since I was just a teen, karna chahta tha me rap
Bana na chahta tha me scene

Yea I Just had a dream
Jub inko na yakeen, put my city on my back
Aaj scene hai haseen


I Just had a dream
Since I was just a teen, karna chahta tha me rap
Bana na chahta tha me scene
Yea I Just had a dream
Jub inko na yakeen, put my city on my back
Aaj scene hai haseen


[Verse 2]

Charcha hone lagi, badne lagi baat
Mujhe apnane lage - ladke jo school me the hard

(That’s Krsna, he’s safe man, he can rap init -
Oi Krsna bruv, can you rap for a minute)

Aise baatein sunke me bhi hone laga khush
Hanging with the crooks, meri badali puri look

Baggy tracks, air max on my foot, rock karta
Parka Jacket with the fur on the hood

Ab MC Phyxer hogaya addict sa
Kharida sasta mic aur lagaya on the mixer

Record kare jaakee mene tape pe tape
Verses the ek se ek, dekh I know you get the picture

Me tha khush, mene dhoondi apni calling
Raat ko pirate radio stations pe karta call in

Ab Jaise hi school me mujhe thori pehchaan mili
Next thing I know, I’m on a flight back to delhi (what the fuck)


[Chorus]
I Just had a dream
Since I was just a teen, karna chahta tha me rap
Bana na chahta tha me scene
Yea I Just had a dream
Jub inko na yakeen, put my city on my back
Aaj scene hai haseen


I Just had a dream
Since I was just a teen, karna chahta tha me rap
Bana na chahta tha me scene
Yea I Just had a dream
Jub inko na yakeen, put my city on my back
Aaj scene hai haseen


[Verse 3]

Umar 16, dilli bhi lagne laga ab naya
Sochta tha me aksar yaar kidhar fas gaya

Jo banaya wo gawaya, mujhe bahut fikar
Kyunki Kiski ko hip hop ka na thoda bhi shauk idhar

School ki copy ke peeche likhta tha lyrics
Apne favourite rappers ke flow bhi Karta tha me mimic

Aise nikale 2 saal, I thought it was finished
Par 18 pe college me meri Banane lagi image

Mile Su.1 aur 2D, jinhe rap ka tha shauk
Hum ne banaya ek group - Illicit Cash Mobb

2005, Record kiye Kuch gaane humne
Hip Hop Nights Delhi me, log bhi pehchane hume

Young and hungry, wo din ab lagte hai best
We Didn’t rap for the cheques, we just rapped for respect

Fir 2006 me, solo artist bana me next
Naam rakha Prozpekt, I guess you know the rest

(I guess you know)


[Chorus]
I Just had a dream
Since I was just a teen, karna chahta tha me rap
Bana na chahta tha me scene
Yea I Just had a dream
Jub inko na yakeen, put my city on my back
Aaj scene hai haseen

I Just had a dream
Since I was just a teen, karna chahta tha me rap
Bana na chahta tha me scene
Yea I Just had a dream
Jub inko na yakeen, put my city on my back
Aaj scene hai haseen
